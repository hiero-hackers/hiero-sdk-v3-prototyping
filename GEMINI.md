# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and other agents) when working in this repository.

## What this repository is

This is a **proof-of-concept (PoC) for the next generation ("V3") of client SDKs/libraries** for the
[Hiero](https://hiero.org) project under Linux Foundation Decentralized Trust (LFDT). Because Hedera and other
networks build on Hiero, V3 targets all of them — it is explicitly broader than just Hedera.

The current SDKs are all at version 2; **V3 is the codename for the new generation** that replaces them. V3 is
designed from scratch with **no backward-compatibility constraints** with V2.

**This repo contains specifications, not a shippable SDK.** There is no build system (no Maven/Gradle/npm/Cargo) and
nothing compiles. The API is defined once in a **language-agnostic meta-language** and is meant to be translated into
idiomatic implementations per language (Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python, C++, Swift). The `.java`/`.js`
files under `guidelines/` are **illustrative reference snippets**, not a buildable module.

### How the layers relate

- **`base`** — primitives every layer depends on (`ledger`, `keys`, `nativeToken`/`hbar`, `common`, `proto`, `grpc`).
  The native token is modeled as an abstraction (`nativeToken`) with HBAR as one concrete implementation (`hbar`), so
  the SDK is not bound to Hedera.
- **`consensusnode.*`** — the low-level client: build/sign/execute transactions against the consensus node. The
  `spi` namespace exists because the consensus node is service-oriented and supports *custom* services and transaction
  types, so the SDK must be extensible (hence `TransactionStatus` is an abstraction with an `int32` code, not a closed
  enum).
- **`mirrornode.*`** — read-side: query historical/state data from a Mirror Node over REST, returning paginated
  `Page<$$T>` results.
- **`enterprise.service.*`** — a higher-level convenience/service layer designed for easy use and deep framework
  integration (cf. Hiero Enterprise Java / JS). Provides factory methods today; real deployments use dependency
  injection.

## The spec meta-language (most important convention)

**Before writing or editing any `spec/*.md`, read `guidelines/api-guideline.md`** — it is the source of truth. Key
points to keep specs valid and consistent:

- Each spec file follows the same skeleton: `# Title` → `## Description` → `## API Schema` (a fenced code block) →
  optional `## Examples` → `## Questions & Comments`.
- The `## API Schema` block opens with `namespace <name>`. Types from other namespaces are imported explicitly, one
  statement per source namespace: `requires {Address, Ledger} from ledger`. Import only what is used; `requires {*}
  from ns` imports everything.
- **Imported (and same-namespace) types are referenced by their simple name** (`Address`, `Page`) — like an ES6/Java
  import. The qualified form `namespace.Type` is only used to disambiguate a name collision between two namespaces.
- **Naming:** Types `PascalCase`; fields & methods `lowerCamelCase`; enum values `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; namespaces
  `lowerCamelCase` (dots for sub-namespaces, no hyphens); constants `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`; `@@throws` error ids
  `lowercase-kebab-case` (e.g. `not-found-error`).
- **Generic type parameters are prefixed with `$$`** (e.g. `Page<$$T>`, `Transaction<$$Receipt extends Receipt>`).
- **Annotations use a `@@` prefix.** Common ones: `@@immutable`, `@@nullable`, `@@default(v)`, `@@static`, `@@async`,
  `@@streaming`, `@@throws(...)`, `@@threadSafe[(group)]`, validation (`@@min/@@max/@@minLength/...`), and type-level
  `@@oneOf(...)`, `@@oneOrNoneOf(...)`, `@@finalType`.
- Abstract types use `abstraction`; inheritance uses `extends`; enums use `enum`.

### Cross-cutting design principles (enforce these in specs and reviews)

- **Immutability first:** annotate fields `@@immutable` by default; introduce mutability only with a clear reason.
- **Never define nullable collections** (`list`/`set`/`map`) — return empty instead of null.
- **Avoid `ANY` as a standalone type** — prefer a generic `$$T`, a concrete base type, a `@@oneOf` union, or `bytes`
  with a documented schema. (`ANY` as a *wildcard type argument* like `ContractParam<ANY>` is fine.)
- `@@async` returns a future/promise; `@@streaming` returns a pull-based async stream of items (`streamResult<TYPE>`
  for per-item errors). They are mutually exclusive.

## How to make changes

- **Editing/adding a spec:** keep the section skeleton, declare the `namespace` and import external types with
  `requires {Type} from ns`, reference them by simple name, and follow the naming + annotation rules above. Match the
  style of neighboring spec files.
- **Open design questions** belong under each file's `## Questions & Comments` (often attributed to a GitHub handle).
  Don't silently resolve them; surface them.
- **Language best-practice docs** (`api-best-practices-*.md`) describe how a meta-language concept maps to one
  language — when you add a new meta-language feature, consider whether each language guide needs a mapping (the
  guideline lists per-language mappings for varargs, wildcards, streaming cancellation, `streamResult`, etc.).
- Note: `api-guideline.md` references a `proposals/` folder, but in this repo the specs live under `spec/`.
- Some language guides referenced by `api-guideline.md` (cpp, ts, python, go, swift) do not exist yet — that's
  expected; only Java, Rust, and JS guides are present so far.

## Relevant skills

When working here, these skills are particularly useful:

- **`java-api-design`** and **`java-best-pratices`** — when reasoning about API surface, SPI, interfaces vs. records,
  module boundaries, breaking changes.
- **`modern-java`** — when writing or reviewing the `guidelines/java-files/` reference snippets (use modern idioms:
  records, sealed types, pattern matching, etc.).
- **`adr-create`** — when a genuine architectural decision is made, record it as an ADR.
- **`hiero-info`** / **`hedera-info`** — background when writing prose about Hiero/Hedera concepts.
- **`grill-me`** — to stress-test an API design before committing to it.

## Audience & language

The repository (README, guidelines, specs) is written in **English** for an international open-source audience — keep
new docs in English. Commit messages and PR descriptions in English as well.
