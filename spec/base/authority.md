# Authority API

## Description

An `Authority` describes *who or what may act* on an entity — sign for it, update it, mint, and so
on. Accounts, tokens, topics and other entities are guarded by an `Authority`. It is an immutable,
recursive value that is satisfied in one of three ways; composed, it forms a **multi-signature
(m-of-n)** structure:

- **`PublicKeyAuthority`** — satisfied by a signature from a single `PublicKey`.
- **`ContractAuthority`** — satisfied not by a signature but by the named smart **contract** being
  the active executing frame. With `delegatable = false` the contract must be the direct caller;
  with `delegatable = true` the authority may also be exercised via `delegatecall`. This is how,
  e.g., a token's `supplyAuthority` can be a contract so that only that contract's logic may mint.
- **`AuthorityList`** — a composition of child authorities with a `threshold`: at least
  `threshold` of the `children` must be satisfied. **n-of-n** ("all must sign") is simply
  `threshold == children.size()`; **m-of-n** is any smaller threshold. Children are themselves
  `Authority`s, so an account can be guarded by "Alice **and** (2-of-3 of {Bob, Carol, contract})".

Create authorities with the factory methods `of(...)`, `ofContract(...)` and `ofDelegatable(...)`.
An `Authority` received from the network (e.g. in account or token information) can be inspected
by matching on its three variants; the set of variants is closed. A private key is never part of an
`Authority` — only public information is.

## Design Notes

This namespace defines the **authorization model** for the SDK: the structure that decides *who or
what may act* on an entity (sign for it, update it, mint, …). It is the V3 replacement for the
`PublicKey` / `list<PublicKey>` placeholder used across the transaction, query, and mirror-node
specs, and corresponds to HAPI's `Key` message. The design and the alternatives it rejects are
recorded in [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md).

- `PublicKeyAuthority` wraps a [`PublicKey`](keys.md); it deliberately *wraps* rather than *is* a
  `PublicKey` (see below).
- `ContractAuthority.delegatable = false` maps to HAPI's `ContractID`; `delegatable = true` maps to
  `DelegatableContractID`.

### Design rules (see ADR-0004)

- **Composition, not inheritance.** The leaves *wrap* `PublicKey` and `ContractId` rather than
  those types extending `Authority`. This keeps the dependency one-directional
  (`authority → {keys, ledger}`) and lets every variant be co-located so the type can be
  `@@sealed`. The cost, accepted deliberately, is that a bare `PublicKey` / `ContractId` cannot be
  passed where an `Authority` is expected — callers go through the factories, and the read side
  reads `.publicKey` / `.contractId` off the matched variant.
- **A private key is never an `Authority`.** Only public information appears in an authorization
  requirement; [`PrivateKey`](keys.md) has no wrapper here, so it is structurally excluded.
- **No in-band sentinels.** Every distinct meaning is its own type/variant — never a magic value
  or overloaded `null`. `threshold` is therefore always set and always meaningful (n-of-n is a
  real value, not `null`); an empty `AuthorityList` is forbidden (`@@minSize(1)`). "Remove this
  key" is an *operation* on the write side, not an `Authority` value, and is modelled separately
  (a future `KeyUpdate` type — see ADR-0004 follow-ups), not by an empty list.
- **Construction goes through the factories** (`of` / `ofContract` / `ofDelegatable`). They are the
  documented, forward-compatible path; the variants are public so that a received `Authority`
  can be destructured by pattern matching.
- **`@@sealed`** closes the set of variants so consumers can match exhaustively. The annotation is
  not yet part of the meta-language — it is introduced together with this namespace; see ADR-0004.

## Examples

### Build authorities

```
PublicKey alice = ...;
PublicKey bob   = ...;
PublicKey carol = ...;
ContractId dao  = ...;

// single key
Authority single = Authority.of(alice);

// all-of (3-of-3)
Authority allOf = Authority.of(
    Authority.of(alice), Authority.of(bob), Authority.of(carol));

// 2-of-3 multi-signature
Authority twoOfThree = Authority.of(2,
    Authority.of(alice), Authority.of(bob), Authority.of(carol));

// nested: Alice AND (2-of-3 of {Bob, Carol, DAO contract})
Authority nested = Authority.of(
    Authority.of(alice),
    Authority.of(2,
        Authority.of(bob),
        Authority.of(carol),
        Authority.ofContract(dao)));
```

### Inspect a received authority (read side)

```
// `key` comes typed as Authority from e.g. an account / token info query.
String describe(Authority e) {
    switch (e) {                                          // exhaustive via @@sealed
        case PublicKeyAuthority k         -> return "key " + k.publicKey.toString(...);
        case ContractAuthority c          -> return (c.delegatable ? "contract* " : "contract ")
                                                       + c.contractId.toString();
        case AuthorityList l              -> return l.threshold + "-of-" + l.children.size()
                                                       + " [" + l.children.map(describe).join(", ") + "]";
    }
}
```

## Questions & Comments

- **`@@sealed` is forthcoming.** This namespace is written against it; a separate follow-up adds
  `@@sealed` to [`api-guideline.md`](../../guidelines/api-guideline.md) with the per-language
  mappings (Java `sealed`, Rust `enum`, TypeScript discriminated union). Until then the closed set
  is a convention. See [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md).

- **Distinct from `keys.Key`.** [`keys.Key`](keys.md) models cryptographic *material* (`bytes`,
  `algorithm`, `type`); `Authority` is the logical *authorization* construct. They are separate
  hierarchies on purpose — `PublicKeyAuthority` wraps a `keys.PublicKey`.

- **Name is a coinage; `Endorsement` is the documented alternative.** No major ledger names the
  account-authorization construct "authority" (Bitcoin/Solana: "multisig"; Safe: "owners" +
  "threshold"; HAPI/V2: `Key`) — none of those terms can name a root that also covers a single key
  or a contract. The rationale and the `Endorsement` runner-up are in ADR-0004.

- **Building m-of-n from public keys is verbose** (`of(2, of(alice), of(bob), of(carol))`) because
  bare-type usability was surrendered. Convenience overloads taking `PublicKey...` directly
  (`of(2, alice, bob, carol)`) could reduce this, but a single-arg `PublicKey` would be ambiguous
  with the `of(publicKey)` leaf factory, so they are deferred until the ergonomics are judged
  against real usage.

- **Factory discoverability.** A developer looking for multi-signature support searches "multisig"
  / "threshold", not "authority". The keyword is carried in the doc text and on the m-of-n
  factory comment; renaming `of(threshold, …)` to an explicit `multiSig(…)` / `threshold(…)`
  factory is an open option (ADR-0004 rejects naming the *root type* `MultiSig`, not naming a
  factory).

- **Key clearing is not modelled here.** Removing a key (HIP-540, signalled on the wire by an empty
  `KeyList`) is a write-side *operation*, not an `Authority` value. It is deferred to a future
  `KeyUpdate` type on the update transactions — see ADR-0004.

- **Wire round-trip edge.** A redundant on-chain `ThresholdKey(n, n-children)` read back as an
  `AuthorityList` with `threshold == children.size()` canonicalises to the `KeyList` wire form on
  write-back — semantically identical, different bytes.

- **No byte encoding of an `Authority`.** There is no `toBytes()` / `fromBytes(bytes)` for the HAPI
  `Key` protobuf form, so key lists and threshold keys cannot be exchanged in serialized form; a single
  public key round-trips through `PublicKey.toBytes(...)`, an m-of-n does not. The TCK passes and
  expects keys as hex of the protobuf `Key` (`generateKey` with `keyList` / `thresholdKey`, the `key` of
  `createAccount` and `getAccountInfo`, see [`tck-binding.md`](../../tck-binding.md)). Should
  `Authority` get `toBytes()` and `@@static fromBytes(bytes)`, and how do `ContractAuthority` and the
  delegatable contract form map to it?
