# Ledger API

## Description

This namespace hosts the foundational network / addressing types that every other namespace
builds on.

### The address hierarchy

Every entity on a Hiero ledger lives in a `(shard, realm)` space; what differs between entity
kinds is only the **selector** — the third part of the identifier that picks the specific
entity within `(shard, realm)`. That observation drives the type hierarchy:

    class BaseAddress {
        <<abstraction>>
        +shard: uint64
        +realm: uint64
        +checksum: string
        +num: uint64?
        +validateChecksum(ledger) bool
        +toString() string
        +toStringWithChecksum() string
    }

    class Address {
        +num: uint64
    }

    class EvmCapableAddress {
        <<abstraction>>
        +evmAddress: EvmAddress?
    }

    class ContractId

    class AccountId {
        +alias: bytes?
    }

    class EvmAddress {
        +bytes: bytes
        +toString() string
    }

    BaseAddress <|-- Address
    BaseAddress <|-- EvmCapableAddress
    EvmCapableAddress <|-- ContractId
    EvmCapableAddress <|-- AccountId
    EvmCapableAddress ..> EvmAddress : uses

    note for Address "@@override num: uint64\n(narrowed from nullable)\n\nused for: tokens, topics, files, schedules"
    note for ContractId "@@oneOf(num, evmAddress)\n\nHAPI ContractID:\noneof{contractNum, evm_address}"
    note for AccountId "@@oneOf(num, evmAddress, alias)\n\nHAPI AccountID:\noneof{accountNum,\n      alias: bytes\n        — EVM addr OR\n        — HIP-32 key alias}"
```

Nullable fields are marked with a trailing `?` in the diagram (Mermaid has no native
nullable notation); in the spec they carry `@@nullable`. The `num` slot lives on
`BaseAddress` as `@@nullable` and is **narrowed** to non-null on `Address` via
`@@override` — see the *Narrowing inherited nullability* section in
[`api-guideline.md`](../../guidelines/api-guideline.md) for the full rule.

- **`BaseAddress`** is an `abstraction` carrying the shared `(shard, realm, checksum)` and
  the `@@nullable num: uint64` slot, plus the common string / checksum methods. Never
  instantiated directly. The `num` slot is `@@nullable` here because some child kinds
  (EVM-only `ContractId` / `AccountId`) do not carry one.
- **`Address`** is the concrete address kind for entities whose HAPI id is purely
  `(shard, realm, num)`: tokens, topics, files, schedules. It **narrows** the inherited
  `num` slot to non-nullable via `@@override num: uint64` — on every `Address` instance,
  `num` is guaranteed to be set. Also the typed identifier used throughout the spec wherever
  a single-number entity is referenced.
- **`EvmCapableAddress`** is an `abstraction` for entities that can be addressed either
  numerically or by a 20-byte EVM address. Adds the `@@nullable evmAddress: EvmAddress` slot
  shared by `ContractId` and `AccountId`; `num` is inherited from `BaseAddress`, still
  `@@nullable`. Does **not** itself carry an `@@oneOf` — each concrete child tightens the
  constraint with its own `@@oneOf`, which is the LSP-safe direction (subtypes may
  strengthen invariants, never weaken them).
- **`ContractId`** mirrors HAPI's `ContractID` oneof. Structurally empty — `num` and
  `evmAddress` are inherited; ContractId's only contribution is the `@@oneOf(num, evmAddress)`
  constraint.
- **`AccountId`** mirrors HAPI's `AccountID`, but **splits** the opaque `bytes alias` field
  of HAPI into two typed slots — `evmAddress: EvmAddress` (HIP-583 EVM-alias, inherited from
  `EvmCapableAddress`) and `alias: bytes` (HIP-32 public-key alias) — so the type system
  tells the caller which alias form they hold instead of forcing a runtime length check.

The hierarchy is **strictly Liskov-clean**: every child either adds new fields, narrows an
inherited nullability via `@@override` (a tightening), or adds its own `@@oneOf` constraint
(also a tightening). Nothing in the hierarchy weakens a parent invariant. The single
meta-language addition this required is the *Narrowing inherited nullability* rule
documented in [`api-guideline.md`](../../guidelines/api-guideline.md); the `@@oneOf`
constraints sit on the concrete children only, so no constraint widening is needed.

`EvmAddress` is the value type for raw 20-byte EVM addresses — used both as the
`evmAddress` slot in `EvmCapableAddress` and as a stand-alone return type wherever a flat
EVM address appears (mirror-node responses, contract-call results, ...).

## Questions & Comments

- [@hendrikebbers](https://github.com/hendrikebbers): Should we rename `Ledger` to `Network`?
  > [@oGranny](https://github.com/oGranny): In `ledger.config` we have `NetworkSetting` which does not match with `Ledger`, I think either we should rename `Ledger` to `Network` or `NetworkSetting` to `LedgerSetting`
- [@oGranny](https://github.com/oGranny): what are the rules for assigning and creating `Ledger.id` bytes?
