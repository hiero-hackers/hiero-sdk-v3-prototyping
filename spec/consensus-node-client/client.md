# Client API

This section defines the client API.

## Description

The client API is the API that will be used by the SDK to interact with the network.
A client defines a concrete network connection to a specific network with a specific operator account.

## API Schema

```
namespace consensusnode.client
requires {AccountId, Network} from ledger
requires {NetworkSetting} from ledger.config
requires {PrivateKey} from keys
requires {NativeTokenUnit} from nativeToken

// Carries the shared retry-tuning knobs (max attempts, backoff window, per-attempt
// timeout) and the single submit() entry point. The SDK applies these settings
// when selecting a consensus node, retrying transient gRPC failures, and bounding

    // and payment for PaidQuery) are handled by the SDK transparently.

## Examples

The following example shows how to create a `HieroClient` instance:

```
AccountId accountId = ...;
PrivateKey privateKey = ...;
Account operatorAccount = new Account(accountId, privateKey);

NetworkSetting networkSettings = ...;

HieroClient client = HieroClient.createClient(networkSettings, operatorAccount);
```
