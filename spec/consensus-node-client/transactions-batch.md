# Batch Transactions API

This namespace specifies the *atomic batch* transaction of the consensus node's util service
(HIP-551): `BatchTransaction`, which submits several independent transactions as a single
all-or-nothing unit.

## Description

A `BatchTransaction` bundles an ordered list of **inner transactions** and submits them as one
atomic unit. Per HIP-551, *"if any inner transaction fails, the entire batch will fail"* and all
state changes are rolled back atomically — it is all-or-nothing for **state effects**. Each inner
transaction keeps its own `TransactionId`, its own (possibly different) payer, and its own
signatures; the batch adds atomicity of state changes on top, it does not merge the transactions
into one.

**Fees are independent of the atomic outcome.** The outer batch and each *processed* inner
transaction are charged separately and may have different payers; an inner transaction that was
processed is charged its regular fee **even if the batch as a whole fails** and its effects are
rolled back. Atomicity therefore governs committed state, not fees.

The number of inner transactions is bounded by a network configuration parameter (currently tied to
the maximum number of preceding child transactions, ~50), so the SDK does not impose a fixed upper
limit — an over-large batch is rejected by the network as a `TransactionStatus`.

### The inner transactions — independently packed and signed

This is the key difference from `ScheduleCreate` (see
[`transactions-schedule.md`](transactions-schedule.md)). A schedule *captures* an inner transaction
as a plain `Transaction<ANY, ANY>` builder and never packs or signs it — the network materializes it
later. A batch is the opposite: every inner transaction is **fully packed and signed up front**,
possibly by different parties on different machines, and the batch carries the finished, signed
payloads. Inner transactions are therefore modelled as a list of `PackedTransaction`, not as
builders.

Each inner transaction is prepared through the batch-specific entry point on `Transaction` (see
[`transactions.md`](transactions.md)):

- **`batchKey` (a required parameter of the batch-pack methods).** Every batch-pack method takes a
  `batchKey`: the `Authority` that must sign the *outer* `BatchTransaction` for this inner
  transaction to run — the inner author's controlled opt-in to being batched. Because `batchKey` is
  a `TransactionBody` field, it must be fixed **before** signing; setting it afterwards would
  invalidate the inner signatures, the same invariant that drives the `Transaction` →
  `PackedTransaction` split. Passing it as a parameter (rather than as a free-standing build-phase
  field) makes two illegal states unrepresentable instead of network-rejected: an inner transaction
  can never be packed *without* a `batchKey`, and a normally-submitted transaction can never carry
  one. This is deliberately *not* the same as the batchability check below — `batchKey` is an
  SDK-owned, knowable invariant of the batch-pack entry point, whereas which transaction *types* may
  be batched is network policy the SDK cannot know.
- **`packForBatch(...)` / `signForBatch(...)` (pack + sign).** Unlike `pack(payer, nodes)`, these
  produce a **single** `TransactionBody` addressed to no consensus node (`nodeAccountID = 0.0.0`):
  an inner batch transaction is never submitted to a node on its own. They mirror the non-batch
  signing tiers without a `nodes` parameter (each additionally taking the required `batchKey`) —
  `packForBatch(payer, batchKey)` (pure pack, no signature), `signForBatchWithOperator(client,
  batchKey)` (operator convenience), `signForBatch(payer, batchKey)` (one Account pays and signs),
  and the most general `signForBatch(payerId, signer, batchKey)` (payer identity decoupled from an
  HSM / hardware-wallet / paymaster `TransactionSigner`). Any further signatures (multi-sig, offline)
  reuse the inherited `PackedTransaction.sign(...)` / `signableBodies()` flow unchanged.

The resulting `PackedTransaction` instances are passed to `BatchTransaction.innerTransactions`. The
list is **ordered**: the network executes the inner transactions in list order.

### Signing model — no new concept

Authorizing a batch needs nothing beyond the existing `Transaction` → `PackedTransaction`
multi-signature flow, exactly as for schedules:

- The `BatchTransaction` is signed by its own payer, **plus** the `batchKey` of every inner
  transaction. These are ordinary `NodeSignature` entries on the outer transaction; the network
  matches each inner transaction's `batchKey` against the signature set.
- The inner transactions are already self-contained (signed by their own required keys during
  `packForBatch`). The batch does not re-sign them.

So a `batchKey` signature *is* a normal signature on the outer `BatchTransaction` — there is no
separate "batch signature" payload, and the per-node body fan-out of the outer transaction is the
standard model from [`transactions.md`](transactions.md).

### Reading the inner outcomes

Per HIP-551, the batch record does **not** aggregate the inner results: each inner transaction
produces its own record whose `Record.parentConsensusTimestamp` (see
[`transactions.md`](transactions.md)) equals the batch's `consensusTimestamp` — the link from an
inner record back to the batch that ran it — and callers *"must query the individual inner
transactions receipts"* separately to see each inner response code. `BatchReceipt` therefore carries
only the batch transaction's own status (the base `Receipt` fields). To read an inner transaction's
typed receipt, the caller already holds each inner `TransactionId` (the `transactionId` field of the
`PackedTransaction` it packed) and resolves it through the general
`Transaction.getResponse(transactionId, transactionType, client)` factory — the same mechanism used
for the executed inner transaction of a schedule. See the example below.

Per-inner queries are the *only* protocol-supported read path; the inner outcomes cannot be fetched
in bulk through HAPI's child-records query either. `TransactionGetRecordQuery.include_child_records`
returns only node-synthesized children that share the parent's `TransactionId` (disambiguated by a
`nonce`, e.g. HTS precompile calls inside a contract call). Batch inner transactions instead keep
their own independent, user-supplied `TransactionId` (often a different payer), so they are not
nonce-children of the batch and are not returned by a record query against the batch's id. They are
therefore addressed individually by their own ids, and only *correlated* as a group after the fact
via `parentConsensusTimestamp` in the record stream / mirror node.

### No client-side batchability check

HAPI restricts what may appear inside a batch. Per HIP-551 an inner transaction cannot be a network
`freeze`, cannot be another `BatchTransaction` (batches do not nest), and a batch itself must not be
scheduled to run later via `ScheduleCreate`. As with schedulable transactions, the SDK does **not**
enforce this: because the consensus node is service-oriented and supports custom services and
transaction types (see [`transactions-spi.md`](transactions-spi.md)), the SDK cannot know the
batchable set. A disallowed inner transaction is rejected by the network as a `TransactionStatus` on
the receipt, not by a client-side error.

## Examples

### 1. Two parties batch two transfers atomically

Alice and Bob each authorize their own transfer, but want them to settle together — neither runs
unless both do. Each packs their own inner transaction for batch, sets the other-agreed `batchKey`,
and signs it. A coordinator collects the two signed inner transactions, builds the
`BatchTransaction`, and signs the outer transaction with both batch keys.

```
HieroClient client = ...;          // coordinator pays the batch fee
Authority aliceKey = ...;
Authority bobKey = ...;

// Alice prepares her inner transfer (on her machine):
PackedTransaction<TransferReceipt, ...> innerA = new TransferTransaction()
    .hbarTransfers([ new HbarTransfer(alice, NativeToken.of(-10, HBAR_UNIT)),
                     new HbarTransfer(bob,   NativeToken.of(+10, HBAR_UNIT)) ])
    .signForBatch(aliceAccount, aliceKey);  // pack for batch (single body, node 0.0.0) + Alice's
                                            // signature; aliceKey must sign the outer batch

// Bob prepares his inner transfer (on his machine):
PackedTransaction<TransferReceipt, ...> innerB = new TransferTransaction()
    .hbarTransfers([ new HbarTransfer(bob,   NativeToken.of(-3, HBAR_UNIT)),
                     new HbarTransfer(alice, NativeToken.of(+3, HBAR_UNIT)) ])
    .signForBatch(bobAccount, bobKey);

// Coordinator assembles and submits the batch, signing with both batch keys:
Response<BatchReceipt> response = new BatchTransaction()
    .innerTransactions([ innerA, innerB ])
    .signWithOperator(client)      // outer payer signature
    .sign(aliceAccount)            // batchKey signature for innerA
    .sign(bobAccount)              // batchKey signature for innerB
    .submit(client);

response.queryReceipt();           // batch status; both transfers ran, or neither did
```

> `signForBatch(payer, batchKey)` mirrors the non-batch `sign(payer, nodes)` tier (without `nodes`).
> The full set on `Transaction` is `packForBatch(payer, batchKey)`, `signForBatchWithOperator(client,
> batchKey)`, `signForBatch(payer, batchKey)`, and the most general `signForBatch(payerId, signer,
> batchKey)`; any additional signatures use the inherited `PackedTransaction.sign(...)` flow.

### 2. Single operator batches several of its own transactions

The common case: one operator submits several of its own transactions atomically. The operator is
the payer and the `batchKey` of every inner transaction, so it signs the outer batch once.

```
HieroClient client = ...;          // operator pays and is the batchKey
Authority operatorKey = ...;       // the operator's Authority

PackedTransaction<...> t1 = new TopicMessageSubmitTransaction()
    .topicId(topicId).message(msg1)
    .signForBatchWithOperator(client, operatorKey);   // v2 batchify(client, batchKey) equivalent

PackedTransaction<...> t2 = new TopicMessageSubmitTransaction()
    .topicId(topicId).message(msg2)
    .signForBatchWithOperator(client, operatorKey);

new BatchTransaction()
    .innerTransactions([ t1, t2 ])
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);  // one operator signature covers payer + both batchKeys
```

### 3. Read an inner transaction's receipt after the batch executes

The caller holds each inner `TransactionId` from the `PackedTransaction` it packed, and reconstructs
a typed `Response` for it — exactly as for the inner transaction of a schedule.

```
TransactionId innerAId = innerA.transactionId;

Response<TransferReceipt> innerResponse =
    Transaction.getResponse(innerAId, TransferTransaction, client);

TransferReceipt innerReceipt = innerResponse.queryReceipt();
```

## Questions & Comments

- **Open: can the batch key be a composite (`AuthorityList`/threshold) `Authority`, or only a single
  primitive key?** HIP-551 states *"Only Ed25519 and ECDSA(secp256k1) keys and hence signatures are
  currently supported"* for the batch key, and its prose only ever discusses a *single* key per inner
  transaction (*"the top-level `AtomicBatchTransactionBody` must be signed by all batchKey keys"*).
  It does **not** state whether a `KeyList`/`ThresholdKey` is accepted as a batch key. The V3 type
  does not restrict this — `batchKey` is an `Authority`, so a caller *can* construct
  `Authority.of(alice, bob)` (n-of-n) or `Authority.of(2, a, b, c)` (m-of-n) — but whether the network
  honours a composite batch key is unverified and a network-side concern; until confirmed, callers
  should assume a single Ed25519/ECDSA(secp256k1) key is the safe choice. (The Ed25519/ECDSA-only
  signature restriction is itself a network-side constraint, not modelled in the type.)

- **Execution order is modelled as list order but not explicitly guaranteed by HIP-551.** The
  `AtomicBatchTransactionBody.transactions` field is a `repeated Transaction` (order-preserving), and
  inner transactions execute as ordered preceding child transactions, so `list<PackedTransaction>`
  with list-order execution is the faithful model. The HIP does not, however, spell out an ordering
  guarantee in prose — if a strict guarantee is later confirmed (or denied), this note can be
  resolved.
