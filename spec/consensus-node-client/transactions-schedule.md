# Schedule Transactions API


## Description

Provides the schedule-service transactions: `ScheduleCreateTransaction` (store a transaction on the
ledger to be executed later, once its required signatures are collected),
`ScheduleSignTransaction` (contribute a signature toward a stored transaction), and
`ScheduleDeleteTransaction` (remove a stored transaction before it executes).

A *scheduled transaction* is an ordinary transaction whose execution is deferred.
`ScheduleCreateTransaction` captures an **inner transaction** and persists its body on the network
under a new `scheduleId`. The inner transaction executes automatically once the network has
collected every signature its own authorization requires (or, for HIP-423 long-term schedules, when
the schedule expires — see `waitForExpiry`).

### The inner transaction

The inner transaction is a plain `Transaction` builder — the *same* type used everywhere else.
`ScheduleCreateTransaction` only captures its body; the inner transaction is **never packed or
signed itself**. Do not call `pack()` / `sign()` on the inner instance — doing so produces an
unrelated `PackedTransaction` that the schedule ignores; the inner builder is left untouched.

The SDK does not check whether the inner transaction can be scheduled. Some transactions cannot
(e.g. a `ScheduleCreate`, `ScheduleSign`, `ScheduleDelete`, or `freeze`); such an inner transaction
is rejected by the network with a `TransactionStatus` on the receipt.

### Signing model

Signatures that authorize the inner transaction are **ordinary signatures on the outer schedule
transaction** — there is no separate "schedule signature" payload:

- Any signature placed on a `ScheduleCreateTransaction` (beyond the payer) whose public key belongs
  to the inner transaction's required key set is credited to the schedule immediately on creation.
- `ScheduleSignTransaction` carries only the `scheduleId`. Each required key signs the
  `ScheduleSignTransaction` through the normal `pack()` / `sign(...)` multi-signature flow; the
  network extracts the public keys from the signature set, verifies them against the
  `ScheduleSign` body, and credits those that match the inner transaction's required keys.

### Lifecycle and deletion

`ScheduleDeleteTransaction` removes a stored schedule **before** it executes; it requires a
signature from the schedule's `adminKey`. A schedule created without an `adminKey` is immutable and
cannot be deleted — it can only execute or expire. Deleting an already-executed (or already-deleted)
schedule is rejected by the network with a `TransactionStatus`.

The `scheduled` flag of the inner transaction's `TransactionId` is set by the consensus node when
it materializes the inner transaction; it is never set by the SDK.

To read the outcome of the executed inner transaction, pass the `scheduledTransactionId` from the
receipt together with the inner transaction's type to `Transaction.getResponse(...)`.

## Design Notes

- **No SDK-side schedulability check.** Because the consensus node is service-oriented and supports
  *custom* services and transaction types (see `consensusnode.transactions.spi`), the SDK cannot know
  whether a future custom transaction type is schedulable.
- **Signing model — no new concept.** Schedule signing needs nothing on top of the existing
  `Transaction` → `PackedTransaction` lifecycle: a schedule signature *is* a normal `NodeSignature`
  over the outer transaction (key-presence accounting). The per-node body fan-out (one body per
  target node, one submitted, the rest spare) is exactly the standard model from
  [`transactions.md`](transactions.md).
- The `scheduled` flag handling is described under *TransactionId generation* in
  [`transactions.md`](transactions.md).

## Examples

### Schedule a transfer and contribute the operator's signature

The operator stores a transfer that moves value out of Alice's account. The operator signs the
`ScheduleCreate` as payer; because Alice's signature is still missing, the inner transfer does not
execute yet. The receipt yields the `scheduleId` (to collect more signatures) and the
`scheduledTransactionId` (the id the transfer will carry once it executes).

```
HieroClient client = ...;     // operator pays for the ScheduleCreate
AccountId alice = ...;
AccountId bob = ...;

TransferTransaction inner = new TransferTransaction()
    .hbarTransfers([
        new HbarTransfer(alice, NativeToken.of(-10, HBAR_UNIT)),
        new HbarTransfer(bob,   NativeToken.of(+10, HBAR_UNIT)),
    ]);

Response<ScheduleCreateReceipt> response = new ScheduleCreateTransaction()
    .scheduledTransaction(inner)
    .adminKey(operatorAuthority)        // optional: lets the operator delete it later
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

ScheduleCreateReceipt receipt = response.queryReceipt();
Address scheduleId = receipt.scheduleId;
TransactionId scheduledTransactionId = receipt.scheduledTransactionId;
```

### Add a missing signature via ScheduleSign

Alice contributes her signature to the pending schedule. `ScheduleSign` carries only the
`scheduleId`; Alice's authorization is the ordinary signature on the `ScheduleSign` transaction.
The operator pays the fee, Alice co-signs — the same multi-signature flow as any other transaction
(see [`transactions.md`](transactions.md)). Once Alice's key satisfies the inner transfer's
requirements, the network executes it automatically.

```
HieroClient client = ...;     // operator pays the ScheduleSign fee
Account alice = ...;          // the account whose debit the inner transfer needs

PackedTransaction<...> packed = new ScheduleSignTransaction()
    .scheduleId(scheduleId)
    .signWithOperator(client)   // operator signs as payer
    .sign(alice);               // Alice's signature is credited to the schedule

Response<ScheduleSignReceipt> response = packed.submit(client);
TransactionId executed = response.queryReceipt().scheduledTransactionId;
```

### Read the executed inner transaction's receipt

Once the schedule has executed, the caller only holds `scheduledTransactionId` — never a
`Response` for the inner transaction. `Transaction.getResponse(...)` reconstructs a typed,
client-bound `Response` from that id plus the inner transaction's type token, so the inner
receipt comes back typed (here `TransferReceipt`).

```
TransactionId scheduledTransactionId = ...;   // from ScheduleCreateReceipt / ScheduleSignReceipt

Response<TransferReceipt> innerResponse =
    Transaction.getResponse(scheduledTransactionId, TransferTransaction, client);

TransferReceipt innerReceipt = innerResponse.queryReceipt();
```

### Delete a schedule before it executes

The holder of the schedule's `adminKey` removes it before the remaining signatures arrive.

```
new ScheduleDeleteTransaction()
    .scheduleId(scheduleId)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);   // operator holds the adminKey
```

## Questions & Comments

- **`customFeeLimits` (HIP-991) is intentionally absent.** It bounds the custom fees the payer is
  willing to pay for the inner transaction, and its payload depends on the **write-side custom-fee
  model, which is not yet specified in V3** (§3.3 in [`missing-features.md`](../../docs/missing-features.md)).
  This is the same reason `TokenFeeScheduleUpdate` is deferred (see
  [`transactions-tokens-management.md`](transactions-tokens-management.md)). It will be added once
  the write-side `CustomFee` hierarchy exists.

- **Reading the scheduled execution's outcome** uses the general
  `Transaction.getResponse(transactionId, transactionType, client)` factory in
  [`transactions.md`](transactions.md). Because the inner transaction is captured as
  `Transaction<ANY, ANY>`, `scheduledTransactionId` carries no compile-time link to the inner receipt
  type; the caller re-supplies the inner transaction's type token to `getResponse(...)` and gets a
  typed `Response<$$Receipt>` back (the SDK resolves the matching `TransactionSupport`). See the
  *Read the executed inner transaction's receipt* example above.

- **`ScheduleInfoQuery` is not specified here** — read-side schedule state belongs with the other
  consensus-node queries, specified in [`queries-schedule.md`](queries-schedule.md).
