# Token Transactions API

## Description

The token service (HTS — Hedera Token Service, retained as the protocol-level name in Hiero) lets
users create, manage, and operate first-class tokens directly on the consensus node — without
deploying a smart contract. A single token is identified by an `Address` (token id) and is one of
two kinds:

- **`FUNGIBLE_COMMON`** — a divisible currency-like asset with a `decimals` precision and a
  shared supply pool. Balances are tracked per account as an `int64` count of the smallest
  indivisible unit.
- **`NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE`** (NFT) — an indivisible collection where each issued unit is a
  distinct serial number with its own metadata. Balances are tracked per (token, serial).

A token's supply policy is independent of its kind:

- **`INFINITE`** — no protocol-enforced ceiling on `totalSupply`. The supply key may keep minting
  forever (modulo `int64` overflow).
- **`FINITE`** — the protocol enforces `totalSupply ≤ maxSupply` at every mint. A mint that would
  exceed `maxSupply` fails atomically (HAPI: `TOKEN_MAX_SUPPLY_REACHED`).

`maxSupply` applies to both token kinds: for `FUNGIBLE_COMMON` it caps the number of smallest
indivisible units, for `NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE` it caps the number of serials (each serial counts as
one unit, since `decimals` is 0).

Note that the ceiling is checked against the *current* `totalSupply`, not against the number of
units ever issued. A `TokenBurn` (or `TokenWipe`) lowers `totalSupply` and thereby frees room for
another mint. For NFTs this is visible in the serial numbers: they increase monotonically and are
never reused, so a `FINITE` collection with `maxSupply = 10_000` can end up holding a serial number
far above 10,000 while never exceeding 10,000 *existing* NFTs at any point in time. `maxSupply`
therefore bounds how many units exist simultaneously — a "only ever N in total" guarantee
additionally requires the `supplyAuthority` to be unset (or given up) once the last mint happened.

This file covers the **core lifecycle and supply** transactions: `TokenCreate`, `TokenUpdate`,
`TokenDelete`, `TokenAssociate`, `TokenDissociate`, `TokenMint`, `TokenBurn`. The remaining
HTS transactions (`TokenWipe`, `TokenFreeze` / `TokenUnfreeze`, `TokenGrantKyc` / `TokenRevokeKyc`,
`TokenPause` / `TokenUnpause`, `TokenFeeScheduleUpdate`, `TokenUpdateNfts`, and the
HIP-904 airdrop family) are tracked in
[`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section 1.2 and will land in follow-up files
under this same namespace.

### Token keys

A token carries up to seven optional keys, each granting authority over a specific operation. None
of these can be *added* via `TokenUpdate` if they were not set at creation time — leaving a key
unset at create permanently disables that capability (HAPI: `KEY_NOT_PROVIDED`). The keys can be
*rotated* by an update if they were set originally, and (under HIP-540) cleared to an immutable
state.

| Key            | Grants the authority to                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `adminAuthority`     | update token metadata (`TokenUpdate`) and delete the token (`TokenDelete`). Unset → immutable.   |
| `supplyAuthority`    | mint and burn units (`TokenMint`, `TokenBurn`). Unset → fixed supply after creation.             |
| `kycAuthority`       | grant / revoke KYC (`TokenGrantKyc`, `TokenRevokeKyc`). Unset → KYC concept disabled.            |
| `freezeAuthority`    | freeze / unfreeze accounts for this token (`TokenFreeze`, `TokenUnfreeze`). Unset → no freeze.   |
| `wipeAuthority`      | wipe units from a non-treasury account (`TokenWipe`). Unset → wipe disabled.                     |
| `pauseAuthority`     | pause / unpause every operation on the token (`TokenPause`, `TokenUnpause`). Unset → unpausable. |
| `feeScheduleAuthority` | update the token's custom fee schedule (`TokenFeeScheduleUpdate`). Unset → fees immutable.     |
| `metadataAuthority`  | update NFT-level metadata after mint (`TokenUpdateNfts`, HIP-657). Unset → metadata immutable.   |

The `metadata` field on the token itself (and on individual NFT serials) is opaque bytes — typical
uses are an IPFS CID, an HTTPS URL, or an inlined JSON manifest. The token's `decimals`,
`initialSupply`, and `maxSupply` fields are expressed in the smallest indivisible unit (e.g. for a
6-decimals USDC clone, `1_000_000` means "one display unit").

### Treasury account

Every token has a `treasuryAccountId`: the account that receives `initialSupply` at create time and
that all subsequent `TokenMint` units are credited to. Burns also draw from the treasury. The
treasury account must have been associated with the token (implicitly true at create — the protocol
auto-associates the treasury). Treasury rotation via `TokenUpdate` requires both the *current* and
the *new* treasury to sign.

### Token associations

Before a non-treasury account can hold a positive balance of a token it must explicitly *associate*
with it (`TokenAssociate`). Accounts created with `maxAutomaticTokenAssociations > 0` may instead
auto-associate on first inbound transfer up to that limit (HIP-23 / HIP-904); `TokenAssociate`
remains the explicit path. `TokenDissociate` removes an association — the protocol requires the
account to hold zero balance of the token (and zero NFTs of that collection) at dissociate time,
otherwise the transaction fails.

A token's lifecycle is:

```
                                          ┌── TokenMint    ──┐
  create ── (associate | dissociate)* ── ─┤                  ├── update* ── delete
                                          └── TokenBurn    ──┘
```

### Signing requirements (token lifecycle)

| Transaction       | Signers required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TokenCreate`     | the *payer*; **and** the `treasuryAccountId` (auto-association of the treasury implicitly binds the account); **and** the `adminAuthority` if it is set (anti-spoofing: cannot bind another party's key as admin without their consent); **and** the `autoRenewAccount` if it is set and differs from the payer / treasury. Other keys (`supplyAuthority`, `kycAuthority`, ...) do **not** need to sign creation — they gate only future permissioned operations. |
| `TokenUpdate`     | the *payer*; **and** the token's *current* `adminAuthority`; **and**, if a key field is being rotated to a new value, the *new* key (anti-spoofing); **and**, if `treasuryAccountId` is being changed, both the *current* and the *new* treasury accounts; **and**, if `autoRenewAccount` is being changed, the new account. |
| `TokenDelete`     | the *payer*; **and** the token's current `adminAuthority` (an immutable token — `adminAuthority` unset — cannot be deleted; the request fails with `TOKEN_IS_IMMUTABLE`).                                                                                                                                                   |
| `TokenAssociate`  | the *payer*; **and** the `accountId` being associated (the account opting in to hold the token). The token's keys are **not** consulted — anyone may associate to any token.                                                                                                                                    |
| `TokenDissociate` | the *payer*; **and** the `accountId` being dissociated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `TokenMint`       | the *payer*; **and** the token's `supplyAuthority` (mint is impossible if `supplyAuthority` is unset — `TOKEN_HAS_NO_SUPPLY_KEY`).                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `TokenBurn`       | the *payer*; **and** the token's `supplyAuthority`. Burns always draw from the treasury account; the treasury itself does not need to co-sign.                                                                                                                                                                        |

When the operator holds every required key (e.g. operator = treasury = admin) `signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client)`
is sufficient. Multi-key flows go through the `signWithOperator(client).sign(...)` pattern shown
in [`transactions-accounts.md`](transactions-accounts.md).

The general rule (as in topics): a key field on a create transaction must sign **if** binding it
would grant that key authority over a real asset (`adminAuthority`, `treasuryAccountId`,
`autoRenewAccount`). Keys that only gate *future* permissioned operations and confer no liability
right now (`supplyAuthority`, `kycAuthority`, `freezeAuthority`, `wipeAuthority`, `pauseAuthority`, `feeScheduleAuthority`,
`metadataAuthority`) do not need to sign creation.

### Mutability and "clearing" keys / auto-renew

`TokenUpdate` distinguishes "leave unchanged" from "clear":

- A `@@nullable` field set to **null** (or never set on the builder) means *leave unchanged*.
- Clearing an optional `Address`-typed field (`autoRenewAccount`, `treasuryAccountId` is
  non-clearable) uses [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](../base/ledger.md) as the sentinel value.
- Each token key is now the `Authority` authorization type (see
  [`authority.md`](../base/authority.md) / [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md)),
  so it can carry a single key, a contract, or an m-of-n threshold. HIP-540 added the ability to
  *clear* any lower-privilege key to an irrevocably-empty state; clearing is a future write-side
  `KeyUpdate` operation (per ADR-0004), not expressible as an `Authority` value — see
  *Questions & Comments*.

## Examples

### Create a fungible token (operator is admin, treasury, and supply key)

The simplest case: a 6-decimals stablecoin-style token with a fixed-but-mintable supply. The
operator pays, is the treasury, and holds the admin + supply keys, so a single
`signWithOperatorAndSubmit` covers every required signature.

```
HieroClient client = ...;

Response<TokenCreateReceipt> response = new TokenCreateTransaction()
    .name("Example USD")
    .symbol("EUSD")
    .tokenType(TokenType.FUNGIBLE_COMMON)
    .decimals(6)
    .initialSupply(1_000_000_000_000L)         // 1,000,000.000000 EUSD to the treasury
    .treasuryAccountId(client.operatorAccountId)
    .supplyType(TokenSupplyType.INFINITE)
    .adminAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .supplyAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

Address tokenId = response.queryReceipt().tokenId;
```

### Create a finite-supply NFT collection

`tokenType = NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE` forces `decimals = 0` and `initialSupply = 0`. Serials are
allocated by `TokenMint` calls, capped at `maxSupply` once `supplyType = FINITE`.

```
new TokenCreateTransaction()
    .name("Example Art")
    .symbol("EART")
    .tokenType(TokenType.NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE)
    .treasuryAccountId(client.operatorAccountId)
    .supplyType(TokenSupplyType.FINITE)
    .maxSupply(10_000L)
    .adminAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .supplyAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .metadataAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))     // allow per-serial metadata updates (HIP-657)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);
```

### Treasury is a separate account (multi-signature)

The operator pays the fee, but a dedicated treasury account custodies the supply. The treasury
must co-sign — its signature is what binds the treasury to the new token.

```
PackedTransaction<...> packed = new TokenCreateTransaction()
    .name("Acme Loyalty")
    .symbol("ACME")
    .tokenType(TokenType.FUNGIBLE_COMMON)
    .decimals(0)
    .initialSupply(0)
    .treasuryAccountId(treasury.accountId)
    .supplyAuthority(Authority.of(supplyOwnerPublicKey))
    .adminAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .signWithOperator(client)                  // payer + adminAuthority (operator)
    .sign(treasury);                           // treasury authorises being bound to the token

packed.submit(client);
```

### Associate before receiving the token

Bob must associate with `tokenId` before any `TransferTransaction` can credit him. He pays his
own fee here, so a single `sign(...)` is enough.

```
new TokenAssociateTransaction()
    .accountId(bob.accountId)
    .tokens([tokenId])
    .sign(bob, nodes)
    .submit(client);
```

### Mint additional fungible supply

The treasury automatically receives the new units. The `supplyAuthority` (here the operator) must
sign.

```
Response<TokenMintReceipt> response = new TokenMintTransaction()
    .tokenId(tokenId)
    .amount(500_000_000L)                      // 500.000000 additional EUSD
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

int64 newTotalSupply = response.queryReceipt().totalSupply;
```

### Mint NFT serials in a single batch

Up to 10 metadata blobs may be supplied per transaction; the protocol assigns sequential serial
numbers and returns them in the receipt.

```
Response<TokenMintReceipt> response = new TokenMintTransaction()
    .tokenId(nftCollectionId)
    .metadata([
        "ipfs://QmHash1".bytes,
        "ipfs://QmHash2".bytes,
        "ipfs://QmHash3".bytes,
    ])
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

list<int64> newSerials = response.queryReceipt().serials;   // e.g. [1, 2, 3]
```

### Burn fungible / NFT supply

Burning draws from the treasury account; the treasury itself does not need to co-sign — the
supply key authorises the burn.

```
// Fungible:
new TokenBurnTransaction()
    .tokenId(tokenId)
    .amount(10_000_000L)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

// NFT (serials must be currently held by the treasury):
new TokenBurnTransaction()
    .tokenId(nftCollectionId)
    .serials([1L, 2L])
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);
```

### Rotate the supply key (multi-signature)

Both the *current* and the *new* supply key must sign, in addition to the payer and admin key.

```
PackedTransaction<...> packed = new TokenUpdateTransaction()
    .tokenId(tokenId)
    .supplyAuthority(Authority.of(newSupplyPublicKey))
    .signWithOperator(client)                  // payer + adminAuthority (operator) + current supplyAuthority (operator)
    .sign(newSupplySigner);                    // new supplyAuthority

packed.submit(client);
```

### Dissociate and delete

Bob must drain his balance first; then he can dissociate. Once the admin decides the token has
reached the end of its life, the admin key deletes it.

```
// 1. Drain Bob (omitted: TransferTransaction back to treasury).
// 2. Dissociate:
new TokenDissociateTransaction()
    .accountId(bob.accountId)
    .tokens([tokenId])
    .sign(bob, nodes)
    .submit(client);

// 3. Delete the token (admin key signs):
new TokenDeleteTransaction()
    .tokenId(tokenId)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);
```

## Questions & Comments

- **All key fields are the `Authority` authorization type.** Each token key (admin, supply,
  kyc, freeze, wipe, pause, feeSchedule, metadata) is an `Authority` — a single key, a
  contract, or an m-of-n threshold (`AuthorityList`) — introduced in
  [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md) and specified in
  [`authority.md`](../base/authority.md). This resolves the former `PublicKey` placeholder
  and is particularly load-bearing for tokens: real-world deployments routinely guard
  `supplyAuthority` with a treasury-DAO threshold or a contract id, not a single public key.

- **Clearing a key field on `TokenUpdate` — not yet expressible.** HIP-540 lets an admin (or
  the key holder itself) clear any of the seven lower-privilege key fields to an
  irrevocably-empty state (e.g. drop the `adminAuthority` to make a token immutable, drop the
  `wipeAuthority` to permanently disable wipe). Clearing is a future write-side `KeyUpdate`
  operation (per [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md)), not
  expressible as an `Authority` value. For `Address`-typed fields,
  [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](../base/ledger.md) is the existing sentinel —
  `autoRenewAccount(ZERO_ADDRESS)` drops the auto-renew account. `treasuryAccountId` is **not**
  clearable: a token must always have a treasury.

- **`customFees` / `feeScheduleAuthority` interaction is partial.** This file exposes `feeScheduleAuthority`
  on `TokenCreate` / `TokenUpdate` because the field is independent and cheap to model, but the
  write-side `CustomFee` hierarchy needed by `TokenCreate.customFees` and by
  `TokenFeeScheduleUpdate` is **not** specified here. Read-side custom-fee shapes live in
  [`mirror-node-token.md`](../mirror-node-client/mirror-node-token.md); the write-side builder is
  tracked in [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section 3.3 and depends on the
  same `Key` sum type. Adding `customFees: list<CustomFee>` here once the write-side model lands
  is additive and breaks nothing.

- **`TokenWipe`, `Freeze` / `Unfreeze`, `Pause` / `Unpause`, `GrantKyc` / `RevokeKyc`,
  `FeeScheduleUpdate`, `UpdateNfts` are deliberately out of scope of this file.** They live in
  the same namespace and follow the same lifecycle / signing model as the seven transactions
  here — splitting the file keeps the core lifecycle readable. Each gets its own file as it
  lands. Tracked in [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section 1.2.

- **HIP-904 airdrop transactions are deliberately out of scope of this file.**
  `TokenAirdrop` / `TokenClaimAirdrop` / `TokenCancelAirdrop` / `TokenReject` reuse the
  association rules described here but interact with `PendingAirdropId` and the new
  `pendingAirdrops` mirror-node domain; they deserve their own spec rather than being smuggled
  into the lifecycle file. Tracked in [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section
  1.2.

- **`TokenMint` / `TokenBurn` cap at 10 NFTs per transaction.** That is the current HAPI limit
  (`TOKEN_MAX_BATCH_SIZE_REACHED`) and is encoded as `@@maxLength(10)` on the `metadata` and
  `serials` lists. If a future HIP raises the cap (HIP-1300 jumbo transactions touch this area),
  the annotation widens — callers that respected the previous cap remain valid.
