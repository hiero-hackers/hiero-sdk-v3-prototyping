# Topic Transactions API

## Description

The topic service (HCS — Hiero Consensus Service) is an ordered, append-only message log
identified by a topic id. Producers submit messages; consensus order across all producers is
established by the consensus node and republished by mirror nodes for subscribers.

Each topic carries two optional keys that control how it can be modified and used:

- **`adminAuthority`** — required to update or delete the topic. When unset, the topic is
  **immutable**: nobody, not even the original creator, can change its metadata or delete it.
  The topic will then live until its expiration time and be removed by the protocol.
- **`submitAuthority`** — required to submit messages to the topic. When unset, the topic is
  **public**: any account may submit. When set, only callers who sign with this key may post.

Like accounts, topics expire and can be auto-renewed: `autoRenewPeriod` is the renewal window
the protocol applies when expiration approaches, and `autoRenewAccount` (optional) names the
account that pays the renewal fee. If `autoRenewAccount` is unset, renewal is paid by the
topic itself (from any HBAR it received via HIP-991 custom fees — outside the scope of this
file).

A topic's lifecycle is:

```
  create ── update* ── delete
                  │
                  └── (TopicMessageSubmit, modelled separately)
```

`TopicMessageSubmit` and the HIP-991 custom-fee fields (`customFees`, `feeScheduleAuthority`,
`feeExemptAuthorities`) are deliberately out of scope of this file — see *Questions & Comments*.

### Signing requirements (topic lifecycle)

| Transaction      | Signers required                                                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TopicCreate`    | the *payer*; **and** the new `adminAuthority` if it is set (anti-spoofing: cannot bind another party's key as admin without their consent); **and** the `autoRenewAccount` if it is set and differs from the payer. The `submitAuthority` does **not** need to sign creation — it gates only future submits, no spoofing risk. |
| `TopicUpdate`    | the *payer*; **and** the topic's *current* `adminAuthority`; **and**, if `adminAuthority` itself is being rotated, the *new* key; **and**, if `autoRenewAccount` is set/changed to a different account, that new account |
| `TopicDelete`    | the *payer*; **and** the topic's current `adminAuthority` (an immutable topic — `adminAuthority` unset — cannot be deleted; the request fails with `UNAUTHORIZED`) |

When the operator holds every required key, `signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client)` suffices.
Multi-key flows go through the same `signWithOperator(client).sign(...)` pattern shown in
[`transactions-accounts.md`](transactions-accounts.md).

The general rule: a key field on a create transaction must sign **if** binding it would grant
that key authority over a real asset (admin / auto-renew payer / treasury / ...). A key field
that only gates *future* permissioned operations and confers no liability or authority right
now (here: `submitAuthority`) does not need to sign creation.

### Mutability and "clearing" keys / auto-renew

`TopicUpdate` distinguishes "leave unchanged" from "clear":

- A `@@nullable` field set to **null** (or never set on the builder) means *leave unchanged*.
- `adminAuthority` / `submitAuthority` are now the `Authority` authorization type (see
  [`authority.md`](../base/authority.md) / [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md)).
  Clearing an optional key (e.g. removing `adminAuthority` to make the topic immutable, or removing
  `submitAuthority` to make the topic public) is a future write-side `KeyUpdate` operation (per
  ADR-0004), not expressible as an `Authority` value — see *Questions & Comments*.

## Examples

### Create a public, immutable topic

No `adminAuthority`, no `submitAuthority`. Anyone may submit messages; no one — not even the creator —
can ever change the topic's metadata or delete it. Useful for cases where the operator wants
an unalterable audit log.

```
HieroClient client = ...;

Response<TopicCreateReceipt> response = new TopicCreateTransaction()
    .topicMemo("audit-log")
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

Address topicId = response.queryReceipt().topicId;
```

### Create a private, mutable topic (operator controls both keys)

```
new TopicCreateTransaction()
    .adminAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .submitAuthority(Authority.of(client.operatorPublicKey))
    .topicMemo("ops-events")
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);
```

### Rotate the admin key (multi-signature)

Both the *current* and the *new* admin key must sign, in addition to the payer.

```
PackedTransaction<...> packed = new TopicUpdateTransaction()
    .topicId(topicId)
    .adminAuthority(Authority.of(newAdminPublicKey))
    .signWithOperator(client)        // payer + current adminAuthority (operator)
    .sign(newAdminSigner);           // new adminAuthority

packed.submit(client);
```

### Delete a topic

```
new TopicDeleteTransaction()
    .topicId(topicId)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);
```

## Questions & Comments

- **`adminAuthority` / `submitAuthority` are the `Authority` authorization type.** Both fields are an
  `Authority` — a single key, a contract, or an m-of-n threshold (`AuthorityList`) —
  introduced in [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md) and
  specified in [`authority.md`](../base/authority.md), resolving the former `PublicKey`
  placeholder.

- **Clearing `adminAuthority` / `submitAuthority` / `autoRenewAccount` on update — partial coverage.**
  HAPI distinguishes "leave unchanged" from "remove" via sentinel values that the consensus
  node interprets server-side:
  - For `Address`-typed fields (`autoRenewAccount`): the sentinel is `0.0.0`, exposed as
    [`ZERO_ADDRESS`](../base/ledger.md) in the `ledger` namespace. Pass `ZERO_ADDRESS` to
    `autoRenewAccount(...)` on an update to drop the auto-renew account.
  - For the `Authority`-typed fields (`adminAuthority`, `submitAuthority`): clearing — e.g. turning a
    private topic public via update or freezing an updatable topic by removing its admin key —
    is a future write-side `KeyUpdate` operation (per
    [ADR-0004](../../docs/adr/0004-authority-authorization-sum-type.md)), not expressible as
    an `Authority` value.

  V2 SDKs additionally expose dedicated `clearAutoRenewAccountId()` / `clearAdminKey()` /
  `clearSubmitKey()` methods that hide the sentinel from callers. V3 could later layer the
  same convenience methods over the sentinels (additive change) — see the placement
  decision recorded in the `ZERO_ADDRESS` comment in `ledger.md`.

- **`TopicMessageSubmit` is out of scope of this file.** Message-submit shares the chunking
  question raised in [`transactions-files.md`](transactions-files.md) (`FileAppend` chunked
  appends) and additionally interacts with HIP-991 custom-fee limits; it deserves its own
  spec rather than being smuggled into the lifecycle file. Tracked in
  [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section 1.5.

- **HIP-991 custom-fee fields are out of scope.** `TopicCreate` / `TopicUpdate` in HAPI
  carry `customFees: list<FixedCustomFee>`, `feeScheduleAuthority: Key`, and
  `feeExemptAuthorities: list<Key>` for revenue-generating topics. These are tracked in
  [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) sections 1.5 and 2.3 and depend on a
  write-side custom-fee model that does not yet exist in the spec. Adding them here is
  additive and breaks nothing.
