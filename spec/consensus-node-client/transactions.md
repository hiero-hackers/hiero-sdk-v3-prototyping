# Transactions API

This namespace defines the lifecycle of transactions submitted to the consensus node, from a mutable
builder through a wire-ready, signed payload to an executed response.

## Description

A transaction passes through two clearly separated states, modelled as two distinct types:

1. **`Transaction<$$Receipt, $$Self>`** — a mutable builder. Concrete subtypes (defined under sub-namespaces
   such as `consensusnode.transactions.accounts`) expose service-specific fields; the generic
   transaction-level fields (`maxTransactionFee`, `validDuration`, `memo`) are inherited from this
   abstraction. A `Transaction` is not yet bound to a payer, target nodes, or a `TransactionId`.

2. **`PackedTransaction<$$Receipt, $$Transaction>`** — a frozen, serializable, wire-ready
   transaction. Packing binds the transaction to a payer, a set of target consensus nodes, and a
   freshly generated `TransactionId`. The body is byte-stable from this point on; further
   `NodeSignature` entries may be appended (multi-sig), but no field of the body may change.

The split exists because signing is a function over **exact byte content**: a signature is computed
over the serialized `TransactionBody`, which includes the target node's `nodeAccountID`. Allowing
the body to mutate after signing would silently invalidate every previously collected signature and
break round-trips through serialization. Modelling the two states as two types makes this constraint
visible in the type system rather than relying on documentation or runtime checks.

The naming follows that purpose: `Transaction` is the editable form; `PackedTransaction` is the form
that has been *packed* for the wire (carrying its target nodes, transaction id, and any signatures
collected so far). See ADR-0001 for the full rationale, including why this is preferred over a
single mutable type or a `freeze()` step on `Transaction`.

### Lifecycle

```
  build              pack              sign               submit
   ──▶ Transaction ──▶ PackedTransaction ──▶ PackedTransaction ──▶ Response
                          (0 signatures)        (n signatures)
```

- **build** — construct a concrete `Transaction` subtype and populate its service-specific fields.
- **pack** — bind to a payer `Account`, a list of target nodes, and generate a `TransactionId`.
  Produces a `PackedTransaction` with an empty `nodeSignatures` list. This is the explicit hand-off
  point between the editable and the immutable world.
- **sign** — append one or more `NodeSignature` entries. Several mechanisms are supported
  (see *Signing mechanisms* below).
- **submit** — hand the packed transaction to one of the target consensus nodes and obtain a
  `Response`. The chosen node is an SDK-internal detail; the caller does not steer it. Actual
  ledger execution happens on the network asynchronously — the `Response` is the submission
  acknowledgment, not the execution result. Use `Response.queryReceipt()` /
  `Response.queryRecord()` to read the outcome once consensus is reached. `submit(client)` is
  inherited from `Submittable` (defined in `consensusnode.client`), which also carries the
  shared retry-tuning fields.

A `PackedTransaction` may be serialized via `toBytes()` at any point, shipped to another process or
machine, re-loaded via the static `fromBytes(...)` factory, and have further signatures appended on
the receiving side. The transaction id, the target nodes, and the already-collected signatures all
survive the round-trip.

### Signing mechanisms

The signing surface is intentionally tiered, with one convenience method per common case and one
data-oriented escape hatch for out-of-process workflows:

| Caller has | Method |
|---|---|
| A configured `HieroClient` with operator | `Transaction.signWithOperator(client)` (or `signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client)` for fire-and-forget) |
| A single `Account` that pays *and* signs | `Transaction.sign(payer, nodes)` |
| A separate payer address and a `TransactionSigner` (HSM, hardware wallet, paymaster) | `Transaction.sign(payerId, signer, nodes)` |
| An already-packed transaction that needs another in-process signature (multi-sig) | `PackedTransaction.sign(account)` or `PackedTransaction.sign(signer)` |
| Out-of-process signing (async pipeline, multi-party, audit archival, raw HSM bytes) | `PackedTransaction.signableBodies()` + `PackedTransaction.sign(signatures)` |

Signature ordering is irrelevant — `NodeSignature` entries form a set; the consensus node accepts
them in any order. The packed transaction can also be built first via `Transaction.pack(...)`
without any signature and shipped to one or more signers downstream.

### Why one signing key contributes N signatures

Each `TransactionBody` carries a `nodeAccountID` field naming the consensus node it was prepared
for. The network rejects bodies addressed to a different node (`INVALID_NODE_ACCOUNT`) — a
protocol-level replay protection. When a transaction is packed for N target nodes, N distinct
`TransactionBody` byte sequences are produced, differing only in that field. Consequently each
signing key contributes N signatures, one per `(node, body)` pair. This is encapsulated in the
`NodeSignature` type. `signableBodies()` exposes the matched `NodeBody` payloads for external
signers.

### TransactionId generation

The `TransactionId` (payer + `validStart` timestamp + `scheduled` flag + `nonce`) is generated
during `pack(...)`. The fields are set as follows:

- `payer` — the address of the `Account` passed to `pack(...)`.
- `validStart` — "now minus a small drift offset", set by the SDK.
- `scheduled` — always `false`; the consensus node sets `true` when materializing a
  `ScheduleCreate`.
- `nonce` — always `0`; the consensus node uses non-zero values only for child transactions
  spawned by smart-contract execution.

The `TransactionId` is **never user-settable** through this API. Custom validity windows or
deterministic ids for testing must be modelled by a different mechanism if needed in the future.

## Examples

The examples below use a hypothetical `AccountCreateTransaction` (a concrete subtype of
`Transaction`, defined under `consensusnode.transactions.accounts`) to illustrate each flow. The
patterns apply to any concrete transaction type.

### 1. Operator does everything

The most common path. The `HieroClient` provides the operator account, the target nodes, and the
network routing.

```
HieroClient client = ...;

Response<AccountCreateReceipt> response = new AccountCreateTransaction()
    .initialBalance(...)
    .authority(...)
    .signWithOperatorAndSubmit(client);

AccountCreateReceipt receipt = response.queryReceipt();
AccountId newAccountId = receipt.accountId;
```

### 2. Distinct payer, single signature

A non-operator `Account` pays for and signs the transaction. The caller supplies the target nodes
explicitly.

```
HieroClient client = ...;
Account payer = ...;            // not necessarily the operator
list<AccountId> nodes = client.ledger.networkSetting().getConsensusNodes()
                            .map(n -> n.address);

PackedTransaction<...> packed = new AccountCreateTransaction()
    .authority(...)
    .sign(payer, nodes);

Response<AccountCreateReceipt> response = packed.submit(client);
```

### 3. Paymaster pattern (sponsor pays, user signs the operation)

The sponsor's `Account` is the payer; the user's `TransactionSigner` (an HSM or hardware wallet)
adds the operation signature. The sponsor signs after the fact on the resulting
`PackedTransaction` — because the protocol requires the payer to sign as well.

```
Account sponsor = ...;
TransactionSigner userSigner = ...;     // wraps HSM / Ledger / etc.
list<AccountId> nodes = ...;

PackedTransaction<...> packed = new TransferTransaction()
    .addHbarTransfer(...)
    .sign(sponsor.accountId, userSigner, nodes)     // user's operation signature
    .sign(sponsor);                                  // sponsor's payer signature

packed.submit(client);
```

### 4. Multi-sig collected across processes

A treasury account guarded by a `KeyList` is co-signed by three independent custodians. The
`PackedTransaction` is built once, serialized, and shipped to each custodian for signing.

```
// Coordinator builds and packs (no signatures yet):
PackedTransaction<...> packed = new TransferTransaction()
    .addHbarTransfer(treasury, -amount)
    .addHbarTransfer(recipient, +amount)
    .pack(treasuryAccount, nodes);

bytes payload = packed.toBytes();
// payload travels to custodian A (e.g. via signed HTTPS):

// Custodian A:
PackedTransaction<...> received = PackedTransaction.fromBytes(payload);
bytes signedA = received.sign(custodianA).toBytes();
// signedA travels back; coordinator forwards to custodian B, etc.

// Coordinator finalises:
PackedTransaction<...> finalTx = PackedTransaction.fromBytes(signedC);
finalTx.submit(client);
```

### 5. Out-of-process / async signing (server-side pipeline)

An online server packs and persists the transaction, dispatches the signable bodies to a remote
signing service via a queue, and resumes once signatures return — possibly minutes later, possibly
on a different worker.

```
// Web request handler:
PackedTransaction<...> packed = new ContractCallTransaction()
    .contractId(...)
    .functionParameters(...)
    .pack(userAccount, nodes);

db.store(jobId, packed.toBytes());
queue.publish(SigningJob(jobId, userPublicKey, packed.signableBodies()));
return Accepted(jobId);

// Later, on a worker, after signatures arrive via webhook:
PackedTransaction<...> resumed = PackedTransaction.fromBytes(db.load(jobId));
list<NodeSignature> signatures = ...;      // produced by remote signer
PackedTransaction<...> signed = resumed.sign(signatures);
signed.submit(client);
```

## Questions & Comments

- **`setRegenerateTransactionId(boolean)` is intentionally NOT part of V3.** In v2 the SDK
  silently regenerates a `TransactionId` (and retries) when the network rejects a transaction
  with `TRANSACTION_EXPIRED` or `INVALID_TRANSACTION_DURATION`. This is **incompatible with the
  V3 transaction model** and will not be re-introduced.

  The fundamental problem: every `NodeSignature` on a `PackedTransaction` signs the serialized
  `TransactionBody` bytes, and the body carries the `TransactionId`. Regenerating the id
  therefore changes the body bytes, which silently invalidates every signature already
  collected. In V3, signing is modelled around exactly this property — the
  `Transaction` → `PackedTransaction` split (ADR-0001) exists so that the byte-stable signing
  surface is visible in the type system, and the offline / multi-party / HSM flows documented
  above (`signableBodies()`, `sign(list<NodeSignature>)`, `fromBytes(...)`) all assume the
  packed bytes do not mutate.

  A "regenerate and retry" toggle on top of those flows would either:
  - silently drop the previously collected signatures (data loss the user did not consent to —
    the custodians who already signed never agreed to a different `TransactionId`), or
  - go behind the type-system guarantee that `PackedTransaction.toBytes()` is the canonical
    payload (every consumer who persisted a `toBytes()` snapshot would now diverge from the
    submitted one).

  Neither is acceptable. The V3 contract for `TRANSACTION_EXPIRED` is therefore explicit:
  callers re-build (`Transaction.pack(...)`) and re-collect signatures. A future high-level
  helper at the `enterprise.service.*` layer **may** wrap "pack + sign with operator + submit;
  on TRANSACTION_EXPIRED repeat the whole pack+sign cycle" for the single-signer case where
  the loss-of-signatures problem is moot — but that lives above this layer, not as a flag on
  `Transaction`. Tracked in
  [`missing-features.md`](../../missing-features.md) section 1.9.

- **`packForBatch(...)` and the `signForBatch(...)` tiers live on the base `Transaction` abstraction
  (not on a `BatchTransaction` subtype) because *any* transaction may be an inner member of a batch
  (HIP-551).** `packForBatch(...)` is a distinct pack entry point rather than an overload of
  `pack(payer, nodes)` because an inner batch transaction produces a *single* body addressed to no
  node (`nodeAccountID = 0.0.0`), so the per-node body fan-out and the `nodes` parameter do not apply.
  The `batchKey` (the `Authority` that must sign the outer batch) is a `TransactionBody` field, so —
  exactly like the `setRegenerateTransactionId` reasoning above — it must be fixed before signing.
  It is taken as a **required parameter** of these batch-pack methods rather than modelled as a
  free-standing build-phase field: doing so makes "an inner transaction always carries a `batchKey`"
  and "a non-batch transaction never carries one" structural guarantees of the type system rather
  than preconditions the network must reject. An earlier draft modelled `batchKey` as a `@@nullable`
  field on `Transaction` with a `missing-batch-key-error` thrown by `packForBatch`; folding it into
  the parameter removes both the nullable field and the error. The `BatchTransaction` container
  itself is specified in [`transactions-batch.md`](transactions-batch.md).
