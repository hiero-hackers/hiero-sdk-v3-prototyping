# Service API

## Description

The enterprise service layer sits on top of the low-level consensus node and Mirror Node APIs and makes common tasks
easy to perform and to integrate into enterprise applications and frameworks. Every concrete service
(`AccountService`, `FungibleTokenService`, `NftService`, `TopicService`, `FileService`, `SmartContractService`) is
created from a `Session`.

A `Session` bundles what all services of one workflow share:

1. **Network configuration** — the `NetworkSetting` describing the target ledger and any tunables.
2. **Operator credentials** — the `Account` used to pay for transactions, plus an optional `TransactionSigner` if the
   private key lives outside the process (HSM, KMS, wallet).
3. **Read-your-writes consistency across services** — every successful write executed through a service of the
   session advances a *high-water-mark* (the consensus timestamp of the receipt). Before any service of the same
   session reads from the Mirror Node, it waits until the Mirror Node has data at or beyond that high-water-mark. So
   within one session, `nftService.transferNft(...)` followed by `accountService.findById(...)` reflects the balance
   change, even though the two calls hit different back-ends with different propagation delays. The wait cannot be
   disabled; use the low-level APIs directly if you need raw throughput without this guarantee.

Streaming operations such as `TopicService.subscribe(topicId)` are live subscriptions and do not wait; every other
Mirror Node read does. A session that never writes never waits. Sessions are independent of each other: a write in one
session never blocks a read in another. A `Session` is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from any number of
threads or asynchronous tasks.

Use one `Session` per **workflow** — the logical unit a write and its follow-up reads belong to, such as an HTTP
request, a batch-job iteration or a processed message — not one per process. Sharing a single session across a whole
server would make unrelated workflows wait for each other. Framework integrations bind the session to the matching
scope (for example request scope) so that injected services just work. Consistency across process boundaries is not
supported yet.

## Design Notes

The service layer is a layer on top of the classical SDK functionalities (that exist in V2 and V3). The idea is to
make it easier to use the SDK and to allow a better integration in enterprise applications. Every concrete service
(`AccountService`, `FungibleTokenService`, `NftService`, `TopicService`, `FileService`, `SmartContractService`) is
constructed from a `Session` defined in this namespace.

### Why the session must span all services

The high-water-mark is a **global ledger property**, not per service type. A `SmartContractService.callContractFunction`
can change HBAR balances, NFT ownership, token supply, and topic state in a single transaction. Splitting the
consistency scope per service type would let a follow-up `accountService.findById` see a stale state right after the
contract call. Putting every service of a workflow into the same session is therefore the only correct granularity.

### Opt-out

The service layer offers **no toggle to disable the wait**. Applications that need raw throughput should go directly
to the lower-level `mirrornode.*` and `consensusnode.*` APIs, which expose the same operations without the
consistency guarantee.

### Scoping in framework integrations

The correct lifetime of a `Session` is **one workflow**, not one process. A workflow is whatever logical unit a write
and its follow-up reads belong to: a single HTTP request, a single batch-job iteration, a single scheduled task run,
a single message processed by a worker. Sharing one `Session` across the whole server is wrong — it would couple
unrelated workflows (user A's write would block user B's reads) and undermine the isolation property documented
above.

How that maps to common framework integrations:

- **Spring (servlet stack):** `Session` becomes a `@RequestScope` bean (with `ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS`). The
  concrete `*Service` beans stay singletons and hold the scoped-proxy, so developers can `@Autowired` services into
  any controller or service bean without thinking about lifecycle. Inside the request, every service sees the same
  underlying session instance.
- **Spring (reactive / WebFlux):** request-scope is not thread-bound, so the session lives in the Reactor
  `ContextView` instead. The adapter is responsible for putting a fresh `Session` into the context at the start of
  the exchange and for forwarding it across `flatMap` boundaries.
- **Kotlin coroutines / structured concurrency:** the session is a `CoroutineContext.Element` propagated by the
  language's own context-propagation rules.
- **Non-HTTP workloads (`@Scheduled`, `@Async`, Spring Batch, Kafka listeners, CLI tools):** there is no built-in
  scope. Either define a custom scope (`@JobScope`, `@StepScope`, thread-bound scope) or create and close a session
  manually around the unit of work (`try`/`with`/`use`).
- **Plain SDK usage / scripts / tests:** one `Session` per logical operation, created via `createSession(...)` and
  discarded afterwards.

A framework adapter is therefore responsible for two things:

1. Picking the right scope abstraction (request, exchange, job, message, …) and binding `Session` to it.
2. Hiding the scope from the developer so that `@Autowired NftService` (or its language-equivalent) "just works".

### Threading

`Session` is `@@threadSafe`: the high-water-mark is monotonically advanced (newer timestamps win) and can be read and
advanced concurrently from any number of threads or asynchronous tasks.

### Distributed workflows (multiple processes)

When one workflow spans multiple processes — e.g. service A submits a transaction and synchronously calls service B
which then queries the Mirror Node — the high-water-mark must travel with the call. Today this is not supported and
must be solved at a higher layer (e.g. by sleeping, by waiting on an event, or by always going through service A for
reads). A future iteration of `Session` is expected to add an opaque consistency-token export/import pair so that an
HTTP/gRPC interceptor (analogous to W3C Trace Context propagation) can forward the token across process boundaries.
See the open question below.

## API Schema

```
namespace enterprise.service
requires {NetworkSetting} from ledger.config
requires {Account, TransactionSigner} from consensusnode.client

@@threadSafe
abstraction Session {

    // Waits until the Mirror Node has caught up to the session's high-water-mark, i.e. until it reflects
    // all writes executed through this session. Returns immediately if no write has been executed yet.
    // Throws if the Mirror Node does not catch up within the session's timeout.
    @@async @@throws(service-error) void awaitConsistency()
}

// Default factory: the session signs every transaction with the operator account's private key.
@@static Session createSession(networkSettings: NetworkSetting, operatorAccount: Account)

// Factory for setups where signing happens out of process (HSM, KMS, wallet).
@@static Session createSession(networkSettings: NetworkSetting, operatorAccount: Account, transactionSigner: TransactionSigner)
```

## Questions & Comments

- **Cross-process consistency-token propagation.** Should `Session` expose `exportConsistencyToken(): @@nullable
  string` and `importConsistencyToken(token: string)` so that a framework adapter can forward the high-water-mark
  across HTTP/gRPC boundaries via a header (e.g. `X-Hiero-Consistency`)? The token would be opaque so the
  underlying representation (currently just a `zonedDateTime`) can evolve. Out of scope for the first iteration but
  required as soon as workflows span multiple processes — see "Distributed workflows" above.
- Should `awaitConsistency()` accept an explicit timeout override per call, or only be configured at session
  creation? Currently the wait/timeout policy is an implementation detail of the session.
- Is `service-error` enough on `awaitConsistency()`, or do we want a distinct `consistency-timeout-error` so callers
  can branch on it? Today the surrounding services already throw `service-error` for everything, so introducing a
  new id would only pay off if applications regularly need to recover from this specific failure mode.
